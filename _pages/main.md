I am a PhD student in Statistics at Imperial College London. I joined the [EPSRC CDT in Modern Statistics and Statistical Machine Learning at Imperial and Oxford](https://statml.io/) in 2020 under the supervision of Professor [Axel Gandy](https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~agandy/) and Dr [Andrew Duncan](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~aduncan/). My research interests lie in computational statistics, distribution testing and kernel methods. In particular, I am interested in using Kernelized Stein Discrepancy to solve problems in computational statistics.

## News
- [08/2023] Starting from October 2023, I will become an [Enrichment Student](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/studentships/enrichment) at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), where I will join the Turing's research community for six months to broaden my research. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you are interested in collaboration!

- [05/2023] Our paper [A High-dimensional Convergence Theorem for U-statistics with Applications to Kernel-based Testing](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v195/huang23a.html) has been accepted by COLT 2023.

- [04/2023] Our paper [Using Perturbation to Improve Goodness-of-Fit Tests based on Kernelized Stein Discrepancy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14762) has been accepted by ICML 2023.

- [09/2022] I finished my internship at [Meta](https://research.facebook.com/), where I worked on multi-task active learning methods for e-commerce.
