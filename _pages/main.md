Hi there! My name is Xing ([pronunciation](https://translate.google.co.uk/?sl=zh-CN&tl=en&text=%E8%A1%8C&op=translate); similar to "H'sing"). I am a PhD student in Statistics at Imperial College London. I joined the [EPSRC CDT in Modern Statistics and Statistical Machine Learning at Imperial and Oxford](https://statml.io/) in 2020, where I have been advised by Professor [Axel Gandy](https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~agandy/) and Dr [Andrew Duncan](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~aduncan/). 

My research interests lie in the intersection of kernel methods and computational statistics. Specifically, I am exploring the applications of Kernelized Stein Discrepancy to address challenges in computational statistics, including areas such as distribution testing, particle-based inference and parameter estimation.

## News
- [12/2023] From 17th to 21st, I will attend the 2023 IMS International Conference on Statistics and Data Science (ICSDS) in Lisbon, where I will give a contributed talk on our COLT paper [A High-dimensional Convergence Theorem for U-statistics with Applications to Kernel-based Testing](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v195/huang23a.html).

- [10/2023] Starting from October 2023, I will become an [Enrichment Student](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/studentships/enrichment) at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), where I will join the Turing's research community for six months to broaden my research. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you are interested in collaboration!
